# SvelteKit and Server Sent Events (SSE)

Trying to do a MVP for SSE with SvelteKit and Cloudflare as per [this Cloudflare community post](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/server-sent-events-readablestream-not-working/645073/2).

- [ ] TODO Does this really follow SSE spec? Need to use `EventSource` in the client side? And use `data: ` format. More info [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events)?

```sh
mise install
npm install
```

```sh
npm run dev
```
